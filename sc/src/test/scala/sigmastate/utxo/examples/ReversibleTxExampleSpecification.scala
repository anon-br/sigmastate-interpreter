  /**
    * Reversible Transaction example.
    *
    * Often lack of reversible payments is considered a drawback in Bitcoin. ErgoScript allows us to easily design
    * reversible payments.
    *
    * Use-case:
    *
    *  Consider the hot-wallet of a mining pool or an exchange. Funds withdrawn by customers originate from this hot-wallet.
    *
    *  Since this is a hot-wallet, its private key can get compromised and unauthorized withdraws can occur.
    *
    *  We want to ensure that in the event of such a compromise, we are able to "save" all funds stored in this wallet by
    *  moving them to a secure address, provided that the breach is discovered within 24 hours of the first unauthorized withdraw.
    *
    *  In order to achieve this, we require that all coins sent via the hot-wallet (both legitimate and by the attacker)
    *  have a 24 hour cooling off period, during which the created UTXOs are "locked" and can only be spent by a trusted
    *  private key (which is different from the hot-wallet private key)
    *  Once this period is over, those coins become normal and can only be spent by the customer who withdrew.
    *
    *  This is achieved by storing the hot-wallet funds in a <b>Reversible Address</b>, a special type of address.
    *
    *  The reversible address is a P2SH address created using a script that encodes our spending condition.
    *  The script requires that any UTXO created by spending this box can only be spent by the trusted party during the
    *  locking period. Thus, all funds sent from such addresses have a temporary lock.
    *
    *  Note that reversible addresses are designed for storing large amount of funds needed for automated withdraws
    *  (such as an exchange hot-wallet). They are NOT designed for storing funds for personal use (such as paying for a coffee).
    *
    *  We use the following notation in the code:
    *
    *  Alice is the hot-wallet with public key alicePubKey
    *
    *  Bob with public key bobPubKey is a customer withdrawing from Alice. This is the normal scenario
    *
    *  Carol with public key carolPubKey is the trusted party who can spend during the locking period (i.e., she can reverse payments)
    *
    *  Once alicePubKey is compromised (i.e., a transaction spending from this key is found to be unauthorized), an "abort procedure"
    *  is to be triggered. After this, all locked UTXOs sent from alicePubKey are suspect and should be aborted by Carol.
    *
    *  A reversible address is created by Alice as follows:
    *
    *  1. Alice creates a script encoding the "reversible" logic. Lets call this the withdrawScript
    *  2. She then creates a script called depositScript which requires that all created boxes are to be protected by withdrawScript.
    *  3. She a deposit a P2SH address for topping up the hot-wallet using depositScript.
    *
